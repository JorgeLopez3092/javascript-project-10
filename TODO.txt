in Data.js, make functions that returns all courses from api. Done!

in Public.js, grab that function from context.data and iterate through the returned array to make one course
component per returned course.  (should create a course component too); Done!

Work on sign up: Sign UP done.
Work on sign in: done  
creating Course: almost, need to figure out how to store and maintain password in state

Finish turning Context into a function with hooks.  Currently changing functions that use SetState into making them use setProperty from useState hook.
